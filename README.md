### BlueprintJS by Palantir...  
  Here is an examples repo that actually works (npm run dev)...  
  With just a couple tweaks to a couple package.json files...  

### Instructions...  
  cd ./packages; npm install;  
  cd ./docs-data; npm install; npm run compile;  
  cd ../docs-app; npm install; npm run dev;  

### ??  
  Please let me know if that doesn't work.
