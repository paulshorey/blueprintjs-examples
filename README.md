### BlueprintJS by Palantir...  
  Here is an examples repo that actually works...  
  With just a couple tweaks to a couple package.json files...  

### Instructions...  
  1. cd blueprint/packages; npm install;  
  2. cd blueprint/packages/docs-data; npm install;  
  3. cd blueprint/packages/docs-app; npm run dev;  

# NOTE:  
  node_modules folder inside "blueprint/packages/docs-app" IS uploaded to this GIT repository!!!  
  The other node_modules folders are ignored. This is because I don't have time or care very much to figure out how I got this repo to run, and don't feel like going through it again.  

### ??  
  Please let me know if that doesn't work.
